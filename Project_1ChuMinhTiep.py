# # Part I. ETL Pipeline for Pre-Processing the Files

# ## PLEASE RUN THE FOLLOWING CODE FOR PRE-PROCESSING THE FILES

# #### Import Python packages 

# In[13]:


# Import Python packages 
import pandas as pd
import cassandra
import re
import os
import glob
import numpy as np
import json
import csv


# #### Creating list of filepaths to process original event csv data files

# In[14]:


# checking your current working directory
print(os.getcwd())

# Get your current folder and subfolder event data
filepath = os.getcwd() + '/event_data'

# Create a for loop to create a list of files and collect each filepath
for root, dirs, files in os.walk(filepath):
    
# join the file path and roots with the subdirectories using glob
    file_path_list = glob.glob(os.path.join(root,'*'))
    #print(file_path_list)


# #### Processing the files to create the data file csv that will be used for Apache Casssandra tables

# Apache Cassandra tables

# # Part II. Complete the Apache Cassandra coding portion of your project. 
# 
# ## Now you are ready to work with the CSV file titled <font color=red>event_datafile_new.csv</font>, located within the Workspace directory.  The event_datafile_new.csv contains the following columns: 
# - artist 
# - firstName of user
# - gender of user
# - item number in session
# - last name of user
# - length of the song
# - level (paid or free song)
# - location of the user
# - sessionId
# - song title
# - userId
# 
# The image below is a screenshot of what the denormalized data should appear like in the <font color=red>**event_datafile_new.csv**</font> after the code above is run:<br>
